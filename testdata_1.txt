1 9 failure sweden 'second capacitor held steady, but beam did not penetrate'
2 7 failure sweden 'beam succeeded to penetrate material, but not evaporate target'
3 6 success denmark 'spot on'
4 7 failure germany 'fuel cells depleeted immediately - must have been old'
5 9 Failure denmark 'insect on targeting lens - exterminator booked for cleanup'
6 8 Success sweden 'fastidious corrosion on the fastening belt'
7 7 Success germany 'failure in the coolant - but overal test success'
8 6 Failure denmark 'spectrometer not calibrated properly - good fuel cells'
9 5 failed denmark 'succeess on beam penetration - fuel cell died shortly after'
10 6 succeeded denmark 'narrow band emitter failed and burned up shortly after'
11 7 failed germany  'nothing worked - really'
12 8 succceeded sweden 'results from denmark reproduced'
13 9 failed sweden 'german results reproduced - nothing worked - one of those days'
14 9 Succeeded germany 'success even though we failed to calibrate emitter diode'
15 8 Failed sweden 'vaporization initiated but beam not held steady enough'
16 7 success germany 'increased fuel cell efficiency allowed for longer trial'
17 6 failure denmark 'fuel cell failed during trial - backup successfully started'
18 7 success denmark 'nothing of interest'
19 9 failed sweden 'focal point failed to destabilize material bonds - no evaporation'
20 8 succeeded germany 'spot on - everything went as planned'
21 5 failure Sweden 'failed test setup - hardware not properly calibrated'
22 7 failure Germany 'test aborted - previous test in lab had not cleaned up properly'
23 8 fail denmark 'fastening belt snapped'
24 5 success Denmark 'beam energy fluctuated wildly - probably due to fuel cell'
25 7 success Sweden 'weak fuel cells again - we need them to be more stable'
26 6 success germany 'all ok'
27 9 Succeeded Germany 'nothing out of the ordinary'
28 8 success Denmark 'new fuel cells give a steady beam output'
29 6 failure Sweden 'cabling from emitter to phasetizer caught fire'
30 8 Failed denmark 'we don't know why'
